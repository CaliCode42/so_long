Key handler

TD	Is the requested new position a Wall ?

TD		if the new position is a Wall, don't do anything.
		The subject says that the player should not be able to go through walls

TD	Is the requested new position inside the map ?

TD		if the new position is outside the map, don't do anything.
		Normally this shouldn't happen since the map is enclosed in walls but never too sure.

TD	Is the requested new position a Collectible ?

TD		if yes, update the collected items counter and check

TD			check if all collectibles have been collected

TD			    if yes, unlock the exit

TD		update map 2D array and replace collectible by "floor" tile so that it is not drawn 
		in the next iteration of the game loop.

TD	If the requested new position is not a wall, nor a collectible, nor outside the map,
	simply set the player position to the requested new position.
