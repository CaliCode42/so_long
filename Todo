Map checklist:
	Parse the map

		Does the map file exist ?

		Is the map rectangular ?

		All the lines should be the same length.

		Is there something in the map file ?

		Is the map enclosed in walls ?

		    Check the first and last lines and columns, they should all be 1

		Is there only one exit ?

		    Simply count how many E you find on the map.

		Is there only one start position ?

		    Simply count how many P you find on the map.

		Is there at least one collectibles ?

		Simply count how many C you find on the map.

Game checklist

	Create a window using MiniLibX

	    Create the required structure to store all the necessary information

	Load all the required sprites (images) for your game and store them into memory

	Create the different hooks

		key_handler

		mouse_handler (if necessary)

		close_handler, this is a hook on the red cross that closes the program correctly

		loop_hook (=> you game loop)

Render checklist

	Draw the background

	Draw the not movable parts of the map

	Draw the player

Key handler

	Is the requested new position a Wall ?

		if the new position is a Wall, don't do anything.
		The subject says that the player should not be able to go through walls

	Is the requested new position inside the map ?

		if the new position is outside the map, don't do anything.
		Normally this shouldn't happen since the map is enclosed in walls but never too sure.

	Is the requested new position a Collectible ?

		if yes, update the collected items counter and check

			check if all collectibles have been collected

			    if yes, unlock the exit

		update map 2D array and replace collectible by "floor" tile so that it is not drawn 
		in the next iteration of the game loop.

	If the requested new position is not a wall, nor a collectible, nor outside the map,
	simply set the player position to the requested new position.
